        Teaching is one of the most impactful and respected career paths, vital to shaping the social and economic fabric of our society. 
        At SEC, we believe that education is more than academics; it is about fostering the holistic growth of young minds. 
        Our teachers play a pivotal role in this mission, inspiring students to achieve their best while nurturing their individual strengths 
        and preparing them for the challenges of the modern world.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        We seek educators who are deeply committed to their profession and understand the unique ways teenagers learn and thrive. 
        A minimum of a Masterâ€™s degree in the relevant teaching discipline is required, with preference given to experienced teachers. 
        We value individuals who bring enthusiasm, creativity, and dedication to their roles, ensuring that students receive both academic 
        excellence and personal mentorship.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Applications for teaching and non-teaching positions must be routed through the Main Office and are managed by the Public Relations Officer (PRO). 
        The PRO oversees the review and shortlisting of applications, as well as responding to employment inquiries. 
        Direct applications to the Principal or other staff members are not entertained to ensure a structured and fair process.
      </p>
